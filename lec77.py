# Key Points -> Time Module in Python 

# The time module in Python provides a set of functions to work with time-
# related operations, such as timekeeping, formatting, and time
# conversions. This module is part of the Python Standard Library and is
# available in all Python installations, making it a convenient and essential
# tool for a wide range of applications. In this day 84 tutorial, we'll explore
# the time module in Python and see how it can be used in different
# scenarios.

# time.time()

# The time. time() function returns the current time as a floating-point
# number, representing the number of seconds since the epoch (the point
# in time when the time module was initialized). The returned value is
# based on the computer's system clock and is affected by time
# adjustments made by the operating system, such as daylight saving time.
# Here's an example:

# import time
# print(time.time())
# Output: 1602299933.233374

# The time.sleep( ) function suspends the execution of the current thread
# for a specified number of seconds. This function can be used to pause the
# program for a certain period of time, allowing other parts of the program
# to run, or to synchronize the execution of multiple threads.

# time.strftime()

# The time.strftime( ) function formats a time value as a string, based
# on a specified format. TAis function is particularly useful for formatting
# dates and times in a human-readable format, such as for display in a GUI,
# a log file, or a report.

# time.time() : 

# import time 
# def usingWhile():
#     i=0
#     while i<5000:
#         i = i+1
#         print(i)
# def usingFor():
#     for i in range(5000):
#         print(i)
# init = time.time() # return the time in seconds
# usingFor()
# t1 = time.time() - init
# init = time.time()
# usingWhile()
# print(t1)
# print(time.time() - init)

# time.sleep() : 

# import time
# print(4)
# time.sleep(3)
# print("This is printed after 3 seconds")

# time.strftime() : 

import time
t = time.localtime()
formatted_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", t)
print(formatted_time)
