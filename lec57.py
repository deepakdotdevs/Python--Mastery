# Key Points : Getters and Setters

# Getters in Python are methods that are used to access the values of an object's
# properties. They are used to return the value of a specific property, and are
# typically defined using the @property decorator. Here is an example of a simple
# class with a getter method:

# class MyClass:
# def __ init __ (self, value):
# self ._ value = value

# @property
# def value(self):
# return self ._ value

# In this example, the MyClass class has a single property, _value, which is
# initialized in the init method. The value method is defined as a getter using the
# @property decorator, and is used to return the value of the _value property.

# To use the getter, we can create an instance of the MyClass class, and then
# access the value property as if it were an attribute:

# >>> obj = MyClass(10)
# >>> obj.value
# 10

# -------------------------------------------------------

# Program : 

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value
    def show(self):
        print(f"Value is {self._value}")
    # decorator
    @property # it is works as a getter
    def ten_value(self):
        return 10*self._value
    @ten_value.setter # setter
    def ten_value(self, new_value):
        self._value = new_value/10

obj = MyClass(10)
# i want direct value use like :
print(obj.ten_value) # can do using this , but i don't want like this i use @property, like i want 10 times of that value and in that case @property is a getter
obj.ten_value = 67 # this is setter
obj.show()

# Setters

# It is important to note that the getters do not take any parameters and we cannot
# set the value through getter method.For that we need setter method which can be
# added by decorating method with @property_name.setter

# Here is an example of a class with both getter and setter:

# class MyClass:
# def __ init __ (self, value):
# self ._ value = value

# @property
# def value(self):
# return self ._ value

# @value.setter
# def value(self, new_value):
# self ._ value = new_value

# We can use setter method like this:

# >>> obj = MyClass(10)
# >>> obj.value = 20
# >>> obj.value
# 20

# In conclusion, getters are a convenient way to access the values of an object's
# properties, while keeping the internal representation of the property hidden. This
# can be useful for encapsulation and data validation.
