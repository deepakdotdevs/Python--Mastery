# Key Points -> File IO -> read(), readline(), writelines() and other imp methods 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# using file is "myfile3.txt" 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# readline() method is used to read file line by line

# The readline0 method reads a single line from the file. If
# we want to read multiple lines, we can use a loop.

# The readlines0 method reads all the lines of the file and
# returns them as a list of strings.

# Program No. 1 : -> myfile3.txt : 

# f = open('myfile3.txt', 'r')
# while True:
#     line = f.readline() # tb tk us line ko print kr rahe hai tb tk usmein line hai
#     if not line:
#         break
#     print(line)

# Program No. 2 : myfile4.txt : 


# f = open('myfile4.txt', 'r')
# i = 0
# while True:
#     i = i+1
#     line = f.readline()
#     if not line:
#         break
#     m1 = int(line.split(",")[0])
#     m2 = line.split(",")[1]
#     m3 = line.split(",")[2]
#     print(f"Marks of student {i} in Maths {m1}")
#     print(f"Marks of student {i} in Maths {m2}")
#     print(f"Marks of student {i} in Maths {m3}")
#     print(line)

# writelines() method :

# The writelines0 method in Python writes a sequence of strings to a
# file. The sequence can be any iterable object, such as a list or a
# tuple.

# Here's an example of how to use the writelines( method:

# f = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
# lines = ['line 1\n', 'line 2\n', 'line 3\n']
# f.writelines(lines)
# f.close()

# This will write the strings in the lines list to the file myfile.txt. The
# In characters are used to add newline characters to the end of
# each string.

# Keep in mind that the writelines0 method does not add newline
# characters between the strings in the sequence. If you want to add
# newlines between the strings, you can use a loop to write each
# string separately:

# f = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
# lines = ['line 1', 'line 2', 'line 3']
# for line in lines:
# f.write(line + '\n')
# f.close()

# Used file : myfile5.txt -> can create file automatically : 

f=open('myfile5.txt', 'w')
lines=['line 1\n', 'line 2\n', 'line3\n']
f.writelines(lines)
f.close()
